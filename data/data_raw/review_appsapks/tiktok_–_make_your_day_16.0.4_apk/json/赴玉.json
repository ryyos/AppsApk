    "content_reviews": "In China, the Han nationality is the main nationality. The way people think is to think in the way of Han nationality. I want to say. Strictly speaking, China’s history is made up of Han nationality and minority nationality. China is not a single nation. I’m from Manchuria. I love my nation. First of all, I want to confirm. I am Chinese, Manchuria is just a province of China. It is also a Chinese nation. I am not proud of being Manchu, or look down on other nationalities. I think everyone should be equal. Recently on many websites. They are all scolding the Manchu. Let the present Manchu people bear the consequences for the mistakes made by the previous Qing Dynasty. So I see a lot of discord. You have a lot of ethnic separatists. They always focus on the Han nationality. To attack other peoples. Don’t deny that to me. In any website, as long as it is about the Qing Dynasty or satisfied. There will be discordant voices. There is no connection between the present Manchu and the former contentment. The mistakes they made should not be borne by us. Manchu, like other nationalities and Han nationality, is also a very great nation. All nations should be respected. I’m not trying to split the country. Around me, there are many students of Han nationality who treat me very well. There is no ethnic discrimination. I have never thought of splitting the country or making some improper remarks. I am just expounding individual facts. Finally, I hope China. I love Manchuria. I love China",
